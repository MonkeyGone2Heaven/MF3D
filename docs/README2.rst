About the MF3D Tools repository
===============================

This GitHub repository contains code (Matlab and Python) to facilitate
the selection, loading, editing, analysis and saving of images and
animations from the `MF3D stimulus

MF3D R1 Stimulus Set
====================

The macaque face 3D (MF3D) stimulus set release #1 (R1) is the first
database of computer generated images of a parametrically controlled,
anatomically accurate, 3D avatar of the Rhesus macaque face and head.
The intended use of the database is for visual stimulation in
behavioural and neuroscientific studies involving Rhesus macaque
subjects. An overview of the contents of the stimulus set can be found
`here <https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D/wiki/MF3D-Release-%231>`__,
while full details of how the images were generated are available in the
associated publication cited above.

Feature Overview
================

The following video animations demonstrate some of the parameters of the
3D macaque avatar that can be controlled (click images to open videos).

**Facial expression, gaze and lighting**\ <br>
----------------------------------------------

This video demonstrates how our macaque model of emotional facial
expressions (for a single identity) can be continuously and
parametrically varied to adjust appearance. The model was constructed
using computed tomography (CT) data from a real Rhesus macaque, acquired
under anesthesia, and edited and rigged by a professional digital
artist. In addition to control of various facial expressions, the
model's head and eye gaze direction can be programmatically controlled,
as well as other variables such as environmental lighting and surface
coloration, amongst others.<br>

--------------

**Facial dynamics estimation**\ <br>
------------------------------------

In order to simulate naturalistic facial dynamics in the macaque avatar,
we estimate the time courses of facial motion from video footage of real
animals. Applying these time courses to the animation of bones and shape
keys of the model, we can mimic the facial motion of the original clip,
while retaining independent control over a wide range of other
variables. The output animation can be rendered at a higher resolution
and frame rate (using interpolation) than the input video. (Original
video footage in the left panel is used with permission of Off The
Fenceâ„¢).<br>

--------------

**Identity morphing**\ <br>
---------------------------

This video demonstrates how the model of individual variations in
cranio-facial morphology (3D shape) can be continuously and
parametrically varied to adjust appearance, as in the `MF3D R1
Identity <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8226311>`__ stimulus set.
The statistical model was constructed through principal component
analysis (PCA) of the 3D surface reconstructions of 23 real Rhesus
monkeys from computed tomography (CT) data acquired under anesthesia.
The 3D plot in the top right corner illustrates the first three
principal components of this 'face-space', where the origin of the plot
represents the sample average face.

--------------

**Animated sequences**\ <br>
----------------------------

This video demonstrates how animation clips from the `MF3D R1
Animation <https://figshare.com/articles/MF3D_R1_Animations/8226317>`__
stimulus set can be combined to form a longer continuous animation
sequence for use in experiments that require more naturalistic dynamics.
This example was generated using the Python script
```MF3D_ConcatClips_Demo.py`` <https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D-Tools/blob/master/MF3D_Blender/MF3D_ConcatClips_Demo.py>`__
to control Blender's video sequence editor.
